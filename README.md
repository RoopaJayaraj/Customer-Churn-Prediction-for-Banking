# Customer-Churn-Prediction-for-Banking
This project builds a classification model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict whether a bank customer is likely to leave (churn) based on features such as account balance, credit score, tenure, and other relevant attributes. The model aims to help banks identify at-risk customers and implement retention strategies.
